\maketitle

Computational modelling is the process by which phenomena found in complex
systems are expressed algorithmically and/or mathematically.
The creation of such simulations is useful because it allows us to
test whether our understanding is sophisticated enough to create credible
working models of the phenomena we are studying.
In neuroscience and cognitive science especially, computational modelling comprises more than just capturing a single phenomenon, it also provides an implementation of a theory.
Thus, it gives scientists a method of allowing their ideas to be executed, i.e., for emergent properties to appear when they are implemented and run as code \cite{mcclelland09}.

\subsection*{Reproducibility}

For models to be evaluated, it is important to first ensure they are reproducible. 
That is, that they can be recreated based on their specification --- the details deemed important enough to be included in the accompanying article \cite{hinsen15}.
Ideally, this should be possible without contacting the authors for advice, and critically, without looking at the original code \cite{cooper14}.
If the specification is sufficient to successfully recreate the codebase from scratch, then the model is said to be reproducible.
This adds further credence to both the model and its overarching theoretical
framework.
If not, and the model cannot be recreated, then even if the experiments can be carried out successfully within the original codebase, the model is reproducible (given the current specification).

Reproduction is a cornerstone of the scientific method.
If a paradigm or experiment is resistant to attempts at reproduction, related
theories are also brought into question.
An important corollary is that if failures to reproduce happen often then so-called reproducibility ``crises'' occur --- wherein theories lose their credibility in a domino-like effect.


\subsection*{The First Few Steps}

There have been few drastic changes within scholarly communication and research dissemination between 1665, when the first academic journals (\textit{Le Journal des s√ßavans} and \textit{Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society}) were published.
Dissemination of scientific discoveries by publishers continues to consist primarily of static text and figures.
However, most research is underpinned by, if not wholly comprised of, code, which is inherently dynamic.
Given code forms the backbone of modern scientific research, it is perhaps unusual that its position within this framework is not clear.
For example, it is not straightforward where codebases should be placed: in a footnote, as supplementary material, or in a repository somewhere online?
Even if increasingly more journals are requesting code from us, as well as raw data, it is nonetheless striking that an overwhelming number of publishers make no provisions for hosting these files.

Meanwhile in other parts of cyberspace, things are rapidly changing.
A large number of innovative software tools (notebooks, containers, dynamic figures, etc.) have been created that facilitate model sharing and re-use.
For example, the first article with an interactive figure was published a few months ago (REFERENCE TO IT!), and the Jupyter Notebook on the discovery of gravitational waves has been made public.

\subsection*{Towards a Better Science}

Perhaps the scientific community is ready for radical change in the dissemination of computational research, especially with respect to sharing and re-using code.
Initiatives, such as the ReScience journal ({\url{http://rescience.github.io}}), that encourage replication of modelling work, appear to be promising some solutions to the wider problems mentioned above.
